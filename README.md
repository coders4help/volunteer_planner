4. Install all requirements by running `pip install -r requirements/dev.txt`
5. Enter the volunteer_planner dir.
6. Create a mysql database with the name volunteer_planner with access for user [USERNAME] with password [PASSWORD], by entering mysql: `mysql -u root -p[ROOT_PASSWORD]`
7. Type the following commands within the MySQL session:
  1. `create database volunteer_planner;`
  2. `grant all privileges on volunteer_planner to [USERNAME] identified by '[PASSWORD]';`
  3. `\q`
8. Copy man.py to manlocal.py and fill in [USERNAME], [PASSWORD]  as well as an email address (has to be gmail) the corresponding gmail password in the appropriate places in that file.
9. Create database model by running `./manlocal.py migrate`
