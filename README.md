# volunteer_planner
This repro hosts the code for volunteer-planner.org. A platform to schedule shifts of volunteers.


## Setup (Ubuntu 14.04)

1. Install all required Ubuntu packages `apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev mysql-client mysql-server python-dev python-pip git`. This will install MySQL server, Python libraries and Git. It will ask you to set a root password [ROOT_PASSWORD] for the mysql server. Remember the password.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/volunteer-planner/volunteer_planner.git`. An instance of the volunteer_planner will be created in the folder `volunteer_planner`
3. Navigate to that folder `cd volunteer_planner`
2. Create a virtual environment by running `virtualenv --no-site-packages volunteer_planner-venv`
4. Enable the virtual environment by running `source volunteer_planner-venv/bin/activate` (for bash) or `. volunteer_planner-venv/bin/activate.fish` (for fish)
4. Install all requirements by running `pip install -r requirements/dev.txt`
5. Enter the volunteer_planner dir (`cd volunteer_planner`).
6. Copy man.py to manlocal.py (`cp man.py manlocal.py`).
7. Create a mysql database with the name volunteer_planner with access for user [USERNAME] with password [PASSWORD], by entering mysql (using the password from step 1):

    `mysql -u root -p[ROOT_PASSWORD]`
    `create database volunteer_planner;`
    `grant all privileges on volunteer_planner to [USERNAME] identified by '[PASSWORD]';``
    `\q`

8. Open manlocal.py and fill in [USERNAME], [PASSWORD] for MySQL connection as well as an email address (has to be gmail) plus the corresponding gmail password in the appropriate places in that file.
9. Add a superuser `./manlocal.py createsuperuser`. Save username and password.
9. Run the server by running `./manlocal.py runserver`
10. Log in with the superuser's credentials
11. To add new organizations and shifts, you have to access the backend at `127.0.0.1:8000/admin` (you are logged in as superuser)
