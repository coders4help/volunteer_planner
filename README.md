## Setup (Ubuntu 14.04)

### 1.Install all required Ubuntu packages

    sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip git npm

This will install Python libraries and Git.

If you are going to use a local mysql server, additionally install 

    sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev mysql-client mysql-server

This will install MySQL server, it will ask you to set a root password 
[ROOT_PASSWORD] for the mysql server, if you haven't already set up MySQL in the
past. Remember the password.

### 2. Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/volunteer-planner/volunteer_planner.git
    
An instance of the volunteer_planner will be created in the folder 
`volunteer_planner`.

### 3. Create a virtual environment

    virtualenv --no-site-packages volunteer_planner-venv
    
Enable the virtual environment by running 

bash
    
    source volunteer_planner-venv/bin/activate (for bash) or

fish 

    . volunteer_planner-venv/bin/activate.fish

### 4. Install all requirements by running 

    cd volunteer_planner
    
For a local sqlite DB install 

    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt

or, if you intend to use mysql locally, install 

    pip install -r requirements/dev_mysql.txt

### 5. Create a local mysql database and user
    
    mysql -u root -p

    CREATE DATABASE volunteer_planner;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON volunteer_planner.* to vp identified by 'volunteer_planner';
    \q

*Note*: For the local environment, the DB username is assumed to be 'vp' 
and their password is assumed to be 'volunteer_planner'.

### 6. Setup your local environment (optional)

If you need to use non-default settings values, setup the environment variables
in your virtualenv's (post-)activation hooks or your IDE's project settings.

### 7. Initialize the database

    ./manlocal.py migrate

### 8. Add a superuser

    ./manlocal.py createsuperuser
    
You will be asked for username, email and password (twice). Remember that 
username and password.

### 9. Try running the server

    ./manlocal.py runserver

Try opening http://localhost:8000/ in your browser.

### 9. Adding content

To add new organizations and shifts, you have to access the backend at 
`http://localhost:8000/admin`. If prompted, login with the username/password of 
the superuser you created earlier (in case you don't see an error page here).

    http://localhost:8000/admin`

## The Project

We use less for precompiling css. The less file you will find in 
`scheduler/static/bootstrap/less/project.less` To make this work you can just 
initialize the folder with "npm install -g" and then let grunt watch for 
changes.
